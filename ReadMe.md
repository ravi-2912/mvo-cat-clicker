# MVVM [KnockoutJS](http://knockoutjs.com/) Cat Clicker App

A Cat Clicker app to demonstrate  Model-View-ViewModel using [Knockout JS](http://knockoutjs.com/). The app uses `ko.observable` and `ko.observableArray` to bind the cat data to the view in `index.html`.

#### MVVM without [Knockout JS](http://knockoutjs.com/)
The [master branch](https://github.com/ravi-2912/mvvm-cat-clicker/tree/master) demonstrates the same app but without Knockout JS. It is called MVO Cat Clicker App where MVO stands for Mode-View-Octopus :octopus:. We can see significant coding is required. Indeed using a framework is efficienct.
